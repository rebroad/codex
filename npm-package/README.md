# Codex CLI for Termux

> Android Termux package built from upstream OpenAI Codex `rust-v0.146.0`.

This package metadata covers the Termux-focused
`@mmmbuto/codex-cli-termux` line. Version `0.146.0` is released only from the
immutable sanitized GitHub Actions artifact after checksum and release-gate
verification.

## Install after publication

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install nodejs-lts -y
npm install -g @mmmbuto/codex-cli-termux@latest
codex --version
codex login
```

The installed `codex` command is the tracked `bin/codex.js` wrapper. It launches
the bundled `bin/codex.bin` native Android binary, sets `CODEX_SELF_EXE`, and
keeps the bundled C++ runtime visible on Termux. The package also contains the
shell launcher `bin/codex` for direct native use.

## Notes

- Android 10+ / API 29+ on Termux ARM64 (the release binary is built for API 29)
- Built from upstream `rust-v0.146.0`
- Carries only the Termux compatibility delta needed for packaging and runtime
- Real code-mode (`exec`/`wait`) is enabled on the native Android build via the in-process V8 runtime (no longer stubbed) — this is the meaningful capability gain on Termux
- Realtime voice/audio is not part of this build: upstream removed the TUI
  realtime voice surface, so the fork's former Android `cpal`/`oboe` toggle was
  retired as well. A plain Termux CLI process has no Android `JavaVM`/`Activity`
  for that backend; a future Termux-native audio path is tracked separately.
- Packaged launchers preserve bundled `libc++_shared.so` visibility
- Android ELFs are hardened with `RUNPATH=$ORIGIN`
- Fork-owned Android `rusty_v8` prebuilds are used for maintainer cross-builds
- GitHub Actions builds the Android ARM64 tarball from an exact sanitized candidate ref; the maintainer verifies that artifact and publishes the unchanged tarball locally before promoting GitHub `main` and the release
